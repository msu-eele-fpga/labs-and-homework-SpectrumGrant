## Overview
This lab involved setting up an embedded logic analyzer to look at the program developed in lab 04 and verify the outputs are working. 

## Deliverables
Sample depth was set to 64, with transitional qualifiers for storage to minimize memory used, while keeping the acquisition time fast.
