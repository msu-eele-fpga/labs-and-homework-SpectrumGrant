# Homework 5: Vending Machine VHDL

## Overview

This assignment involved three seperate files being made. The first was a debouncer, which would take an input and wait a set amount of time before tracking changes to the input again after a toggle. The second was a one pulse module, it takes inputs of varied length and outputs a single pulse with a duration equal to a clock cycle. The third was an async conditioner which implemented these two components as well as the previously made synchronizer.
